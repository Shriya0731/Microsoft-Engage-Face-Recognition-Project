# Project Title : Airport Passenger Verfication System using face recognition

### Overview
The Passenger check-in process at airports are time consuming and possess a heavy work load on boarding agents. On an average , a paseenger spends most of the time waiting in queue for check-in at the airport. Also, COVID-19 pandemic has resulted into a need of contactless and fast check-in or boarding process.
Imagine gaining entry to the flight within 15 seconds and without any human intervention.
Yes, this is possible with Face Recognition Technology!

To facilate this,  Airport Passenger Verfication System will work as follows:
1. When a passenger books a flight online, the system will collect information about passenger like Name, Passport number, Scanned Passport(in JPG format),  Scanned copy of Aadhar Card(in JPG format), a passport-size photo(in JPG format).
2. Based on the images taken while booking the flight, personGroup is created and trained using Microsoft Azure Face API.
3. At the time of the check-in , passenger will capture his photo and the system will verify its details.
4. If the person is not in the database, he is not given the access.
